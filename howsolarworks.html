					Solar panels
				</h1>
				<p>
					A solar panel is made of numerous small photovaltaic
					cells (photovaltaic means they convert sunlight into 
					energy). These cells alow light particles known as 
					photons to knock electrons away from atoms, creating a
					flow of electricity. Each of these cells is made of 
					"slices" of semi-conducting metal. Usually these parts 
					are made of silicon. 
					
					To work, photovoltaic cells need to establish an 
					electric field. An electric field occurs when 
					opposite charges are separated. To get this field, 
					manufacturers "dope" silicon with other materials, 
					giving each half of the cell a positive or negative 
					electrical charge.

					Charge controller
				</h1>
				<p>
					The charge controller acts as a regulator. 
					It delivers power from the PV array to system loads 
					and the battery bank. When the battery bank is nearly 
					full, the controller will taper off the charging current 
					to maintain the required voltage to fully charge the 
					battery and keep it topped off. By being able to 
					regulate the voltage, the solar controller protects the 
					battery. The key word is “protects.” Batteries can be the 
					most expensive part of a system, and a solar charge 
					controller protects them from both overcharging and 
					undercharging.

				<h1>
					Battery system
				</h1>
				<p>
					Solar batteries work by storing energy produced by 
					your solar panels for later use. When you install a 
					solar battery as part of your solar panel system, 
					you are able to store excess solar electricity at 
					your home instead of sending it back to the grid. If 
					your solar panels are producing more electricity than 
					you need, the excess energy goes towards charging the 
					battery. When your solar panels aren’t producing 
					electricity, for example at night, it will be drawn 
					from the battery.

					DC power
				</h1>
				<p>
					DC stands for Direct current. It is the one 
					directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. 
					An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC power.
					Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a 
					wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, 
					insulators, or even through a vacuum. The electric 
					current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing 
					it from alternating current (AC). this type of current 
					was once known as galvanic current.

				<h1>
					Inverter
				</h1>
				<p>
					A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of 
					electrical converter which takes the direct current  
                    output of a photovoltaic solar panel and converts it 
                    into a utility frequency alternating current that  
                    can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used  
                    by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a  
                    critical balance of system–component in a  
                    photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary  
                    AC-powered equipment. Solar power inverters have  
                    special functions adapted for use with photovoltaic  
                    arrays, including maximum power point tracking and  
                    anti-islanding protection.

				<h1>
					AC power
				</h1>
				<p>
					Unlike direct current, which travels in one direction 
					only, alternating current (AC) changes its magnitude 
					continuously. Electrical power is delivered to 
					businesses and residences in the form of alternating 
					current and it is commonly used when kitchen 
					apliances or a television is plugged into a wall 
					socket. since the electrical power that comes from 
					batteries and battery cells is delivered in the form 
					of direct current (DC), an inverter is needed to 
					change the electrical power into AC.
